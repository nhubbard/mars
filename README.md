# MARS: MIPS simulator

This is a continuation of the original MARS MIPS simulator, rewritten in Kotlin for modern versions of Java.

## To-Do List

* [ ] **Short Term:** Resolve all TODOs and deprecations hiding in the codebase
* [ ] **Short Term:** Replace any former compatibility elements, like explicit method encapsulation instead of property accessors
* [ ] **Short Term:** Replace the legacy JEdit component (v1.18 I think?) with a much newer version (latest is 5.6.0)
* [ ] **Long Term:** Separate MARS core from Venus IDE package and turn it into an IntelliJ IDEA plugin
* [ ] **Very Long Term:** Change over to RISC-V, since MIPS themselves have moved on
