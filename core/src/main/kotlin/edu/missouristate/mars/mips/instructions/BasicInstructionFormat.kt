/**
 * These are the MIPS-defined formats of basic machine instructions.
 *
 * - The R-format indicates the instruction works only with registers.
 * - The I-format indicates the instruction works with an immediate value (e.g., constant).
 * - The J-format indicates this is a Jump instruction.
 * - We define the I-branch-format to indicate this is a Branch instruction, specifically to distinguish immediate
 *   values used as target addresses.
